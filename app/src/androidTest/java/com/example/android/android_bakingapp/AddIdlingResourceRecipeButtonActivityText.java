/**
 * Usually Espresso syncs all view operations with the UI thread as well as AsyncTasks, but it can't
 * do so with custom resources (e.g. activity or service). For such cases, we can register the
 * custom resource and Espresso will wait for the resource to be idle before
 * executing a view operation.
 * <p>
 * In this example, we simulate an idling situation. This test is the same as the
 * MenuActivityScreenTest but with an Idling Resource to help with synchronization.
 * <p>
 * We added an idling period from when the user clicks on a GridView item
 * in MenuActivity to when corresponding order activity appears. This is to simulate potential
 * delay that could happen if this data were being retrieved from the web. Without registering the
 * custom resources, this test would fail because the test would proceed without waiting
 * for the Idling Resource.
